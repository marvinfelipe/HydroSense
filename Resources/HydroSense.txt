INTRODUCTION
Clean water is essential to life, as hydration is the most basic function of water, necessary to keep the body of a living organism hydrated. It is important to preserve and sustain water availability for bodies that rely on water for digestion, metabolism, transportation of nutrients, and temperature regulation. One of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is SDG 6, clean water and sanitation, adopted by the United Nations (UN). SDG 6 clean water and sanitation goal is to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water sanitation for all and achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. 
Billions of people worldwide still live without safely managed drinking water, safely managed sanitation, and basic hygiene services, especially in rural areas and least developed countries. Globally, 44 percent of all household wastewater flows are not safely treated. Thus, access to clean water is fundamental to human health and well-being. They are essential to improving nutrition, preventing disease, and enabling health care. [UN2021] 
In 2020, 47.46% of Filipinos had no access to clean drinking water [BC2021]. Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio [WHO2023]. According to an article by the Department of Health (DOH), the number of people suffering from typhoid fever rose 101% to 3,285 compared to 1,633 in the same period in 2022 [DV2023].
To ensure safe water and proper sanitation is widely recognized as a fundamental human right. Although there has been some advancement toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goal on water and sanitation (SDG 6), current trends and levels of access remain troubling, highlighting the urgent need for solutions that accelerate progress and include everyone. In light of these concerns, the team proposes a combined software-hardware initiative that uses sensors to evaluate water safety levels, ensuring safe and high-quality drinking water. These sensors offer critical insights into contaminants such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, pathogens, and other harmful substances. As a fully integrated solution, HydroSense plays a pivotal role in preventing waterborne diseases and safeguarding drinking water quality for communities around the globe.
HydroSense goes beyond a mere technological breakthrough, offering a crucial solution for communities battling waterborne illnesses linked to insufficient access to clean water. It does more than detect contaminants; it facilitates informed, data-driven decisions. By providing trustworthy resources and guides on hydrology, it equips users with essential knowledge of water management and purification strategies. These materials serve as invaluable references for understanding and effectively managing water resources. Through its integrated software and hardware components, HydroSense empowers communities to proactively monitor and maintain water quality, mitigating risks and safeguarding public health. HydroSense user-friendly interface ensures accessibility for users of all skill levels, encouraging widespread adoption. By raising awareness about waterborne diseases and prevention, it empowers communities to manage their water resources. Its scalable design enables integration with regional systems, creating pathways for more robust and comprehensive solutions.
